# HarfBuzz

Haskell binding for the `HarfBuzz` library.

This binding is automatically generated by [AutoFFI](https://github.com/Krantz-XRF/AutoFFI) from HarfBuzz's C headers. AutoFFI is my course project for this term, and this HarfBuzz binding will evolve together with AutoFFI. I expect AutoFFI and this HarfBuzz binding be usable in this summer.
